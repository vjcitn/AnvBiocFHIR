# AnvBiocFHIR

FHIR interfaces via Bioconductor in AnVIL -- Terra workspace "biocfhir-new2" was introduced by stvjc@channing.harvard.edu October 2021.

A thorough introduction to FHIR in the NIH Cloud Interoperability project is provided in 
a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/NIH-NCPI/fhir-101/blob/master/FHIR%20101%20-%20Practical%20Guide.ipynb) last edited in July 2020.

This workspace is intended to be used with a custom cloud environment to which pyAnVIL and SMART infrastructure have been added.
Dockerfiles are [available](https://github.com/vjcitn/AnvBiocFHIR/tree/main/Dockerfiles).

The R package at [github.com/vjcitn/AnvBiocFHIR](https://github.com/vjcitn/AnvBiocFHIR) uses basilisk
to pin down all details of python infrastructure used to interface to the FHIR services in AnVIL.
